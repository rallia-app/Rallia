-- ============================================================================
-- Circuit Rallia — every win moves the ladder (round-of-N placements)
-- ============================================================================
-- The 5-placement scale flattened everything below the quarters onto
-- 'participated': in a 32 draw, winning your first match paid the same 20
-- base as losing it. ATP-style tables grade every round reached — so does
-- this now. New rungs between participation and the quarters:
--
--   round_of_16 50 · round_of_32 30 · round_of_64 25   (base, x multiplier)
--
-- Monotonic for every legal draw size (max 128: an R128 exit has zero real
-- wins and lands on the zero-win floor anyway). The floor is untouched: a
-- bye-advanced player who never wins a real match stays 'participated', so
-- sparse brackets can't farm depth rungs. Top weights unchanged (the
-- balanced-weighting decision stands).
--
-- Function body is otherwise identical to 20260717150000.
