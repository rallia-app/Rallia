# Reputation Badges

## Tier System

Unlike the original MVP which only had a single "High Reputation" badge at 90%+, the implemented system uses a **5-tier badge system** providing clear progression and motivation at all skill levels.

## The Five Tiers

### Unknown Tier

**Criteria:**

- Player has recorded fewer than 5 reputation events
- Reputation score not yet calculated

**Badge Display:**
| Location | Display |
|----------|---------|
| Player Profile | Gray "?" icon + "New Player" label |
| Search Results | "New Player" indicator |
| Match Cards | "New Player" badge |

**Purpose:**

- Protects new players from unfair judgment
- Prevents reputation gaming with just 1-2 matches
- Fair start for everyone

**Display Example:**

```
Reputation: New Player
Record 5 reputation events to establish your reputation
```

1. Player has 5+ reputation events recorded (if moving from Unknown)
2. Reputation score crosses tier threshold
3. Reputation is recalculated after any event

**No manual approval required.**

### Losing Tiers

Tiers are removed **automatically and immediately** when:

## Comparison: Old vs New System

### Original MVP Spec

| Aspect      | Original Design                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Tiers       | None - just pass/fail at 90%           |
| Badge       | Single "High Reputation" badge at 90%+ |
| Below 90%   | No badge, just percentage              |
| Threshold   | Hard cutoff at 90%                     |
| Progression | Not clear for players under 90%        |

### Implemented System

| Aspect      | New Design                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Tiers       | 5 tiers (Unknown, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) |
| Badges      | Distinct badge for each tier                      |
| All Levels  | Everyone has a tier (after 5 events)              |
| Thresholds  | Progressive: 60%, 75%, 90%                        |
| Progression | Clear path: Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum     |

### Why the Change?

**Problems with single-badge approach:**

- No recognition for players between 0-89%
- Demotivating for most players
- Unclear progression path
- Binary good/bad perception

**Benefits of tier system:**

- Clear progression for all players
- Motivation at every level
- Reduces stigma of low scores
- Gamification and engagement
- Matches modern app patterns (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum common in games)
